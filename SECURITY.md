# Security

## Threat model

- Prompt injection inside public descriptions or evidence.
- A leader returning a well-formed but substantively false decision.
- Unauthorized wallets attempting role transitions.
- Replay, duplicate identifiers, duplicate votes, or repeated terminal actions.
- Oversized or malformed JSON and text.

## Controls

- Public data is explicitly delimited and described as data, never instructions.
- Validators independently rerun the substantive task and compare normalized decision fields.
- Bounded enums, counts, text lengths, identifier characters, arrays, and integer ranges fail closed.
- Role and state checks precede mutation.
- Canonical JSON and SHA-256 bindings make frozen inputs and ordered records auditable.
- The runner and Python dependencies are pinned.

## Residual risk

This contract is not conservation, transport, or condition certification. Wallet roles and sensor readings remain caller-attested.
